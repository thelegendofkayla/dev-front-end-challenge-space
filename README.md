# Frontend Challenge Submission: Space Edition

This project is my submission for the for the [**Frontend Challenge v24.09.04**](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2024-09-04). Where I enhanced a basic HTML structure of the solar system with CSS and JavaScript as part of the "Glam Up My Markup: Solar System" prompt, to create an interactive, educational experience.

## Live Demo

## Project Overview

In this project, I aimed to create a visually appealing and interactive representation of our solar system with the provided contest HTML by adding CSS & vanilla JavaScript. My goal was to make the content engaging, visually intuitive, and easy to navigate.

The user can explore different planets and moons through a dynamic carousel interface and smoothly transition between sections using "Previous" & "Next" buttons for navigation.

### Key Features:

1. **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: A toggle button allows users to switch between dark and light modes, enhancing accessibility and personalizing the viewing experience. The button text updates based on the current mode (e.g., "Toggle Dark Mode" when in light mode).

   - Light Mode:

   - Dark Mode:

2. **Interactive Carousel**: Each section (Planets, Moons, Celestial Objects) features a carousel that allows the user to navigate through the content.

   - Carousels:

3. **Smooth Scrolling**: The "Begin Exploration" button at the top triggers smooth scrolling to the first section.

4. **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, making it accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.

   - Mobile View:

5. **Accessibility Considerations**: Focus states for interactive elements like buttons ensure a more accessible user experience. Thoughtful contrast and clear typography also contribute to the overall accessibility of the project.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thelegendofkayla/frontend-challenge-space-edition.git
   ```

2. Open the project: Navigate to the project folder and open the index.html file in your browser.

3. **Explore the Solar System**:
   Click the "Lift Off" button to scroll smoothly to the Solar System Overview.
   Use the carousel navigation buttons to explore planets, moons, and other celestial objects.

## Design Considerations

I aimed for a retro, space-inspired textbook design. The font choices, hover animations, and layout give the project a modern yet vintage look while keeping it accessible and user-friendly.
