# Frontend Challenge Submission: Space Edition ðŸŒŒ

Welcome to my submission for the [**Frontend Challenge v24.09.04**](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2024-09-04)!

This project is my take on the "Glam Up My Markup: Solar System" prompt, where I enhanced a basic HTML structure of the solar system with CSS and JavaScript to create an interactive, educational experience.

## Project Overview

In this project, I aimed to create a visually appealing and interactive representation of our solar system with the provided contest HTML by adding CSS & vanilla JavaScript.

The user can explore different planets and moons through a dynamic carousel interface and smoothly transition between sections using custom-designed buttons.

### Key Features:

- **Interactive Carousel**: Each section (Planets, Moons, Celestial Objects) features a carousel interface that allows users to navigate through the content interactively.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: The "Lift Off" button at the top triggers smooth scrolling to the Solar System Overview section.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, making it accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: A toggle button allows users to switch between dark and light modes, enhancing accessibility and personalizing the viewing experience. The button text updates based on the current mode (e.g., "Toggle Dark Mode" when in light mode).

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/frontend-challenge-space-edition.git
   ```

2. Open the project: Navigate to the project folder and open the index.html file in your browser.

3. **Explore the Solar System**:
   Click the "Lift Off" button to scroll smoothly to the Solar System Overview.
   Use the carousel navigation buttons to explore planets, moons, and other celestial objects.

## Design Considerations

I aimed for a retro, space-inspired design with a black background and neon green accents. The font choices, hover animations, and layout give the project a futuristic look while keeping it accessible and user-friendly.
